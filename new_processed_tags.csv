Karaktererne og miljøet var fantastisk,overvejer om det er den bedste woody a film jeg har set. den er oppe mod manhattan, men jeg tror det næsten.,den starter isÃ¦r godt ud,isÃ¦r dens struktur er et fedt projekt: at man hele tiden fÃ¦lger nogle nye som de fÃ¸rste gÃ¥r forbi eller mÃ¸der,men dropper stÃ¸rre potentiale mod slutningen,Den fungerer lidt som en kolage som deles ind a tekststykker mellem scenerne - selvom der er et samlende narrativ gennem alle scenerne. den har virkelig mange fine passager. den var tangerende firre en halve på visse tidspunkter,.,den fungerer meget som en samling af gode scener i sig selv, frem for ét sammensat narrativ,den svinger lidt mellem super gode scener og mindre interessante passager, jf. vurdering,hovedpersonen er simpelthen så smuk og sød. den langsomme udforskning af hende, uden at der altid sker så meget, kan være ret fin i sig selv.,Lars von Trier,Nicole Kidman,philosophical,philosophy,political,god ide som har sine gode pasager og momenter. men den taber tit pusten og bliver kedelig. den fumler lidt ideen pÃ¥ gulvet synes jeg.,a prospos fille: dramaet var ret gribende. eksperimentet var ret interessant. og mange af de Ã¦stetiske fragmenter var meget smukke,i starten syntes jeg det stak meget i Ã¸rerne. men det blev til tider ret morsomt. i Ã¸vrigt var det vÃ¦sentligt at der kom noget substantielt narrativ pÃ¥ senere hen hvor starten var en bunke fragmenter,det bedste ved filmen er ikke de små film han laver, men samspillet mellem ham og von trier. han skal udfordre leth og man ved aldrig helt hvornår irritationen er reel over benspændende. det er et sjovt samspil,gavmild,har nogle meget fine ting. men det er ikke helt i top. den er mere eventyragtig og bÃ¸rnefilmagtig end despicable me og megamind,ret stÃ¦rke lÃ¸jer,noget tid siden jeg sÃ¥ den. men husker den som meget flot,sÃ¥ den med iii under meget ufokuseret stemning. sÃ¥ den kan genses inden lÃ¦nge,det er en lidt atypisk rohmer isÃ¦r den mÃ¥de den starter pÃ¥ i et allerede etableret og ulykkeligt parforhold. forholdene plejer oftere at etablere sig gennem filmen,en meget gavmild fille.,Octave figuren genial,det er en MEGET gavmild 4'er,scenen hvor de ude på havet synger den sømandsvise han har skrevet er genial,ending,alt det den forsøger at sige om egoet her jeg ikke teoretisk indsigt til at vurdere,den bruger ret mange forskellige filmiske knep løbende, som er ret interessante. så har den også den der superstylistiske ting kørende som på en måde minder lidt om refens film,den er bare opbygget og fortalt virkelig tight og spændende,den er virkelig vildt konstrueret.,efter seneste sening vil jeg sige, at 5 er gavmildt, tænkte lidt i en halv stjerne mindre, men what the hell,der var nogle ting der sejlede lidt for den eller som ikke var helt sÃ¥ stramme som man kunne have Ã¸nsket - ting der mÃ¥ske ikke blev fuldt op pÃ¥. men alt i alt var den sgu spÃ¦ndende et spÃ¦ndende indblik,de fÃ¸rste 10 minutter er helt fantastiske,desvÃ¦rre synes jeg forholdet ml de to er kedsommeligt - det der udgÃ¸r substansen i filmen - fordi de kun taler om logistikken bag deres mÃ¸der og om hvorvidt de kan tillade sig og mÃ¸des osv.,lille fille,kan ikke finde den,fuld af amerikansk ideologi,den spiller ikke efter de faste strukturer hvilket ellers kunne vÃ¦re forventet. den puller heller ikke nogen lame tricks til alt for billige grin. er positivt overrasket over Segels pen,det er en sjov detalje at deres lille kriminelle kollektiv er relativ tollerant overfor handsome bobs homoseksualitet. det er hele karakterer selvom mange ting er skarpt optrukne,det er i øvrigt en sjov detalje, at de ene samleje der er i filmen bliver lavet som sådan en hurtigklippet passage, som fremstiller forløb trivielle og komiske. det er meget sjovt,tror det er hans mest vellykkede film,virkelig tight fortalt. fede miljøer, fantastiske karakterer, godt plot,Film Theory & Criticism,psychoanalysis,Zizek,Den er meget framentarisk, viser scener på en måde som nok hænger sammen i en historie, men alligevel er meget singulære. det minder mig lidt om godard,ser den lidt som et portræt over sverige. et ret fint portræt. føj hvor er velfærdsinstitutionerne grimme slog det mig i øvrigt.,Den startede virkelig godt. han er genial med hans magtundergravende tørre humor. men da historien begyndte at fylde for meget i anden halvdel af filmen gik det sjove desværre ud af filmen,rigtig fin. det er isÃ¦r fedt hvordan dynamikken forandrer sig helt vildt i deres forhold og Ã¦ndrer filmen i brud.,solid fille,en lille fille,den var slet ikke sÃ¥ flot som hans forrige film. dramaet var ikke helt oppe at ringe men jeg mÃ¥ indrÃ¸mme de var lidt fangende,lille 3 en halle.,thoughtful,den del af filmen hvor han bare går rundt og er fattig og stort set laver ingenting går godt nok utrolig meget i tomgang og bliver meget kedelig. Hvis man skal opleve hans kedsomhed og stilleståenhed så er missionen mere end vellykket,den skulle have været mindst 20 min kortere. alle 20 skåret fra fattigdomssekvensen hvor han bare går rundt.,det er sgu meget interessant, at det handler om en desperat økonomisk nød i den gamle forstand. han tæller bogstaveligt talt mønterne i sin lomme.,er meget splittet om bedømmelsen. i dens gode perioder tænkte jeg 4, måske sågar 4,5. som helhed med fokus på de dårlige sceancer er vi nærmere en 3'er.,god! jeg elsker parisfilm fra denne her æra,han lever fra dag til dag på hoteller, han spilder en olieplet på sit ene jakkesæt,,kan godt lide det med at den desperate stadig går rundt i jakkesæt. det er på en måde typisk fransk,man må virkelig sige det er en atypisk rohmer-film. narrativet er for one thing ikke af romantisk karakter. æstetisk minder den måske om nogle af de første kortfilm i de moralske fortællinger.,Okay, jeg vil måske gerne medgive at den OGSÅ viser det beskidte, fattige paris, men primært i den anden del af filmen,Slutningen er også meget tynd: han får at vide, at han alligvel har arvet hele lortet, og så kører han væk i hans venners åbne sportsvogn, og så er det det. det er så kort en slutning op fattigdommen som et punktum.,overvejede at give en gavmild 3'er, men så sluttede med en række af de værste klicheer fra hollywood. jeg er ikke havende det lort,det er virkelig en god paris-film ogsÃ¥,meget fin lille fortÃ¦lling. har i Ã¸vrigt den prÃ¦cis samme struktur som le collectioneuse,nÃ¦sten,den bliver lidt fantastisk til sidst, når hun faktisk endelig møder sin long lost love på en bus. men som helhed er filmen lidt for langsommelig og flad i det synes jeg. hovedpersonen brænder igennem og er meget smuk,stor tre en halve. den var sgu meget hyggelig og sjov. men dens berettermodel og slaskede feelgoodscener gik endnu lÃ¦ngere end man kunne forvente af en hollywood animation desvÃ¦rre,den havde nogle rigtig flotte skud,synes desvÃ¦rre den var lidt flad i det. som om der skulle ske en stÃ¸rre ting som bare aldrig rigtig skete.,solid fille.,Den var sgu ret fin. den er sÃ¥dan lidt fragmentarisk i det. en masse scener.,spændende. af helvedes til,meget lille tre en halve,gavmild vurdering,den har virkelig mange sjove ting kÃ¸rende for sig. vÃ¦sentlig stÃ¦rkere end den fÃ¸rste. synes den lÃ¥ner nogle ting fra moderne sitcom og er i almindelighed meget moderne i sit indhold sÃ¥som netdating. at wifi gÃ¥r i stykker mm,utrolig flot. meget simpel. den starter desværre en del bedre end den slutter synes jeg.,dramaet er som altid tyndt som det overhovedet kommer,gavmild rating,Der er sågar en 'nu skal jeg fortælle hvad jeg egentlig gjorde sekvens, hvor plottwistet forklares,Nogle af de første scener hvor de to møder hinanden er noget af det mest corny jeg har set, men i kraft af fortællerforholdene i filmen er der måske en grund til dette. de er utroværdige finder man nemlig ud af,Den stiller spørgsmålet hvorvidt der er noget dybere spirituelt gemt i øjnene end den blotte materie og 'data', men den tør ikke helt svare på spørgsmålet, hvorfor den ender på en meget åben og uopklaret måde.,konflikten mellem religion og videnskab kan godt tangere trivialitet nogen gange, men det er ikke så slemt i filmens helhed,ret interessant billede. Det er utrolig visuelt, med det smukke øje i centrum. Folks øjne og briller er et form for tematisk centrum for visualiteten som fungerer ret flot. Eller analogier, såsom lyset gennem vinduets prisme osv.,svært kedeligt opbygget. sad nærmest og driftede ud og ind gennem det meste af filmen"

This is the source code of CS6501-007 Data Mining course project 3 in which we implemented a recommender system base on MovieLens dataset.
Team member: Lulu Meng, Xiaoyu Cheng, Yijing Wang, Xiaoying Li

Usage:

```
python main.py
```

The output will include the RMSE result of each of our model, changing parameters and performing cross-validation.

Use data-preprocess.py and MovieLens 20M data to generate the processed data.
